# How much hate with \#china? Analyze China-related hateful tweets two years since the global pandemic

ENLP term project \& paper


## Data

Tweets hashtagged China posted during Jan 2020 - Jan 2022

## 3 methods or more?

Focus on the most advanced methods here:

* do I need a baseline here?
* snorkel (also to evaluate snorkel in this large unlabled data user case)
* pre-trained language model
* another pre-trained language model
* continue researching...

## Evaluation

evaluate each system using COVID-HATE corpus

## it might be possible to develope a voting system (or other ways to combine the systems in order to get more reliable results) based on the individual systems?

## analysis

* number/percentage of hateful tweets per day during the two years
* overall percentage: number hateful #china/all #china



### possible further analysis using the "best model"

* report \# china hate speech one year before and after the global pandemic (Jan 2019 - Jan 2021)
* Analyze hateful tweets hashtagged with other countries (largest 10 economies) and visualise the comparison
