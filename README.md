__How much hate with \#china? Analyze China-related hateful tweets two years since the Covid pandemic__


## Data

Tweets hashtagged China posted during Jan 2020 - Jan 2022

## 3 methods or more?

Focus on the most advanced methods here:

* do I need a baseline here?
* snorkel (also to evaluate snorkel in this large unlabled data user case)
* pre-trained language model
* another pre-trained language model
* continue researching...

## models 

* [HATE BERT](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-hate)
* [COVID-HATE BERT](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/g9uglvl3cd61k69/AACEk2O2BEKwRTcGthgROOcWa?dl=0)
* [BERTweet](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/bertweet-base-hate)
* [HateXplain/TimeLMs: Diachronic Language Models from Twitter](https://huggingface.co/Hate-speech-CNERG/bert-base-uncased-hatexplain)

* ~~[SNORKEL spam tutorial](https://www.snorkel.org/use-cases/01-spam-tutorial)~~
* ~~[top models in tweeteval-hate]()~~

-> voting system

## Evaluation

evaluate each system using COVID-HATE corpus

## it might be possible to develope a voting system (or other ways to combine the systems in order to get more reliable results) based on the individual systems?

## analysis

* number/percentage of hateful tweets per day during the two years
* overall percentage: number hateful #china/all #china



### possible further analysis using the "best model"

* report \# china hate speech one year before and after the global pandemic (Jan 2019 - Jan 2021)
* Analyze hateful tweets hashtagged with other countries (largest 10 economies) and visualise the comparison
